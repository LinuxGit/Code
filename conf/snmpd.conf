#       sec.name  source          community
com2sec admin     192.168.1.0/24   opensource

#       groupName      securityModel securityName
group   admin           v2c           admin


# Third, create a view for us to let the group have rights to:

#       name           incl/excl     subtree         mask(optional)
view    all            included      .1              80


# Finally, grant the group read-only access to the systemview view.

#       group          context sec.model sec.level prefix read   write  notif
access  admin           ""      any       noauth    exact  all    none   none
